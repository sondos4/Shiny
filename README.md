# Shiny visualization in R

### Project Description

This is the first shiny visualization I worked on. 
I chose to use shiny to create an interactive dashboard to view the participants' statistics in the WEF [Global Shapers](https://www.globalshapers.org/)
 surveys.


### Data
The data is based on the World Economic Forum's Global Shapers suvery. 

### Shiny App
The Shiny app can be found here:

## Other
### Tableau interactive visualizations
Here are other interactive visualizations I did in Tableau based on the survery answers:
